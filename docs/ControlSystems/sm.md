In our case we will use an ESP32 Steamakers programmable microcontroller board as the control element for several reasons:

![](../img/sm/sm1.png){align=right}

* ESP32 based which means, processing power, wifi and bluetooth connectivity, etc.
* Arduino form factor and compatibility with Arduino shields.
* Easy connection. Male pinout available for the board ports, so connection can be done without breadboard.
* Built-in sensors: power, temperature and magnetic field.
* Built-in microSD card reader.
* Arduinoblocks is fully compatible with it, designed for all its functionalities.
* Detailed technical documentation.
* Extensive didactic documentation.
* Quality construction and manufacturer support.
* Designed in Spain by teachers for teaching purposes.
* Several distributors in Spain.
