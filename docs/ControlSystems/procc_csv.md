Once the board with its LoRa receiver is sending data to the PC, the PC must have a serial port reader program that allows to save the data to a file, for this task in GNU/Linux we propose to use Serial Port Terminal ([GTKTerm](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/gtkterm.1.html)). We will also use a real time plotter called [KST](https://kst-plot.kde.org/), which will collect the data from the file recorded by gtkterm and plot it in real time.

The whole process is explained in the following video (Spanish content):

Alternatively, for computers with Windows operating systems, we can use the [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) programme for serial port readings (on Windows com), and for real-time graphing we can also use KST, since it is a multi-platform programme with versions for GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.

The file recorded on the PC via serial communication (via USB) with the LoRa receiver board, or the file stored on the LoRa transmitter's microSD card with the transmitted data, can be analysed and graphed with a spreadsheet, as shown in the following video (Spanish content).
