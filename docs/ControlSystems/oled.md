The OLED screen we are using has a diagonal of 0.96â€™ and a pixel resolution of 128x64. It uses the I2C serial bus connections, which on the ESP32 STEAMakers board have 5 I2C connections, 4 male and 1 female, the latter is where we connect the OLED screen. To know more about this sensor we can see its description in the [Keyestudio wiki](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/Ks0271_keyestudio_OLED_Display_OLED_Module).

The pins of the oled display are connected directly to the female I2C port of the board.

Connect the OLED display correctly to the control board and display the time that has elapsed since the system was switched on. Do this at one-second intervals.
