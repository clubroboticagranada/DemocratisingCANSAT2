Any programmed control system needs an environment to execute the control program, in our case [Arduinoblocks](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/), a graphical programming environment that we will use to program the ESP32 STEAMakers. This environment has been developed by Juanjo LÃ³pez and is available online. You need to have a registered account on the Arduinoblocks website and the [Arduinoblocks Connector](https://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/site/abconnector5) program running on your computer to establish the connection between the online environment and the board.
