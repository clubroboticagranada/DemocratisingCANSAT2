We offer three models that can be used as a basis for the final design of your CANSAT 3D structure.

The 3D structure of the CANSAT (satellite) transmitter of the democratising Cansat proposal is based on a design by David Morales Arellano, a member of the VegaSteam team at the IES Federico Garc√≠a Lorca de Churriana de la Vega (Granada).

It has been designed for easy assembly and replacement of electronic components.
