We offer three models that can be used as a basis for the final design of your CANSAT 3D structure.

This 3D design of the CANSAT body has been designed at the Club Rob√≥tica Granada with the Tinkercad tool. The design is intended to leave as much space inside as possible, housing the ESP32 STEAMakers board with the corresponding sensors and peripherals.
